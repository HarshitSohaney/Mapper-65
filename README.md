# Mapper-65
Large scale GIS Mapping system project created using GTK and C++ at the University of Toronto

This Repository contains a demo of the Mapper Project that I created along with teammates Srinidhi Shankar and Prarthona Paul.

# Software Development Information

## Languages and Tools 

1. C++ 
2. GTK (GUI development)

## Programming paradigm - OOP

1. Extensively used Structs to create various objects for elements like features, points of interests and path tracing data.
2. Created seperate header files to split milestone global variables.
3. Abstraction was implmented with functions that were used for streets, features and path finding.

## Milestones

The project was split into four milestones:
1. Data loading
2. GUI implementation
3. Path Finding Algorithms - *A star and Dijkstras*
4. The Travelling Salesman Problem

The team kept track of various tasks during these milestones through a wiki page and a trello workflow.

## OpenStreetMap

The project used the OpenStreetMap database to parse geographic data. The course team converted xml files to binary files for efficient data accessing. Data was processed using various keywords and structures based on OSM standards.
